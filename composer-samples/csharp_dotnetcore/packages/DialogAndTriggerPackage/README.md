This sample package contains a dialog and supporting declarative assets for greeting new and returning users, as well as a custom trigger that fires when new members join the conversation.

## Getting started

* Published it to a NuGet feed.  For testing purposes, this is easiest when done to a [local feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/hosting-packages/local-feeds). After setting up the local feed, add it to the Package Manager in Composer so that your local packages can be installed in a bot.

* Once you've installed the package in Composer, you can use it in your bot.
