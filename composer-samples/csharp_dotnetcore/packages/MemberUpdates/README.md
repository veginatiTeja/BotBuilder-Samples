# Microsoft.Bot.Component.Samples.MemberUpdates

This sample demonstrates custom triggers for [Bot Framework Composer](https://docs.microsoft.com/composer) that fires when members are added or removed from the conversation.

## Getting started

* Published it to a NuGet feed.  For testing purposes, this is easiest when done to a [local feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/hosting-packages/local-feeds). After setting up the local feed, add it to the Package Manager in Composer so that your local packages can be installed in a bot.

* Once you've installed the package in Composer, you can use it in your bot.

## Feedback and issues
